		<h2>Black Tech Mecca Idea Hack</h2>
		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>To design and present a marketing plan and a new online platform for existing and potentially new members of the Black Tech Mecca community.</p>
		<h3>My Team</h3>
		<p>My team was comprised of five:  two UX designers (myself included), one developer, one sales member, and one marketing member.</p>
		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>We had 24 hours from beginning to end of project. Therefore, we were limited in user feedback.</p>
		<h3>Conditions</h3>
		<p>We worked in an agile, iterative environment over a short timeframe.</p>
		<h3>My contributions</h3>
		<p>I participated in the team sprints, wireframed the profile page and feeder pages, and interviewed about three available users regarding the low fidelity mock-ups, refining the features of the MVP. I also authored pieces of the Google slides that I presented.</p>
		<h3>Skills/Tools</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Whiteboard and post-its for sprints</li>
			<li>Balsamiq for low-fidelity mockups and wireframes</li>
			<li>Google slides</li>
			<li>Slack</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Result</h3>
		<p>Black Tech Mecca will be applying elements of the various teams.</p>
